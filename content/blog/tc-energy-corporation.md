<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">A LogiQuants subscriber asked me to analyze TC Energy Corporation (TSX: TRP)(NYSE: TRP).</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Overall, I like TRP stock as a long-term investment. Not only does it have a 6.84% annual dividend yield, but it has a great all-time graph. TC Energy’s stock price reached an all-time high of $76.58 (Prices in CAD) in February 2020. One month later, during the March 2020 market crash, TRP reached a low of $47.05. Currently, the price per share is $54.40, which is only 15.62% higher than the low in March 2020. Assuming that shares of TC Energy eventually make new all-time highs (i.e. the price goes above 76.58), investing at the current price would net you a return of 40.8%. With dividends on top of that, TC Energy stock is a safe long-term hold. I believe TRP will reach new all-time highs in the coming years.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Although the long-term outlook for TRP shares is good, in the short to medium term, the stock price could easily fall. The number to watch is $50.70 – if the price of TRP stock falls below this threshold, then it will continue to decline. Otherwise, TRP is only going up from here. To make the most of this analysis and minimize risk, I would invest equal amounts of money in TRP at regular intervals, regardless of the price. This is known as cost averaging, and it “aims to prevent a poorly timed lump sum investment at a potentially higher price.” (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp)</span></span>

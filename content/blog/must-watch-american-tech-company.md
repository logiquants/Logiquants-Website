For those interested in crypto and/or gaming, this article is a must-read. This technology company looks like a great opportunity at the moment. Based in California, Newegg Commerce Inc (NASDAQ: NEGG) is an e-commerce business with a focus on technology. More specifically, Newegg serves an online marketplace (like Amazon) for computer parts, consumer electronics, entertainment, smart home and gaming products. The company also provides logistics for third parties.

What I like most about NEGG is its chart. The stock price reached an all-time high of $79.07 in July 2021. Currently, the stock is priced at $1.08. When a stock drops this much, it’s obviously possible that it can go to $0; however, I don’t think that it will. The chart has displayed great short-term momentum.

In terms of fundamentals, Newegg’s 4.19% debt-to-capital is much lower than the industry average of 41.91%. Furthermore, the industry has an average price-to-sales ratio of 9.7 and an average price-to-book ratio of 11.6, whereas Newegg has a price-to-sales and price-to-book ratio of 0.2 and 2.3, respectively.

Given that a significant portion of Newegg’s business comes from selling computer parts, as long as crypto and gaming continue to grow in popularity, Newegg should too. Historically, Newegg’s products have been competitively priced (at least in my experience). So as long as the demand for computer parts grows, naturally, I would expect Newegg’s business to grow. With crypto prices on the rise recently, and people being laid off from work, I believe that crypto mining will grow in popularity. Consequently, the demand for computer parts will increase, as they are needed to construct setups for crypto mining. Last but not least, with gaming and eSports constantly growing, more and more computer parts will be required. Gaming computers are a staple in the gaming community.

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">**Tucows Inc.** (NASDAQ: TCX)(TSX: TC) is a provider of internet services. The company’s headquarters is in Toronto, ON. Tucows’ business consists of 3 different operating divisions. The first division is **Tucows Domains** (tucowsdomains.com), “the world’s second largest domain registrar.” For those who don’t know, domain registrars are in the business of selling internet domain names. Tucow’s second operating division is **Ting Internet** (ting.com/internet). Ting’s focus is to bring fiber internet to “communities across the US, providing businesses and residents with faster, more reliable internet connectivity.” The third operating division of Tucows is **Wavelo** (wavelo.com), “a telecom SaaS start-up that revolutionizes how communication service providers (CSPs) do business.” More specifically, Wavelo provides the software “to help operators worldwide maximize value from their existing infrastructure, focus on customer experience and scale their businesses faster.” Some of Wavelo’s most notable Partnerships and Integrations are with Amazon Web Services (AWS), T-Mobile, AT&T, and Stripe.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">In terms of Tucows stock, I really like the graph. It’s showing a number of the buy signals that I look for. When looking at the graph on shorter time frames (Ex. 3 months, 6 months & 1 year), it looks like the price could explode upwards very quickly. So in other words, if Tucows’ stock price starts to experience any momentum, expect that momentum to continue. Considering that Tucows reached an all-time high of $120.79/share (prices in CAD) in April 2019, the current stock price is likely too low. Sitting at just $37.27/share today, I’m predicting that the price will rise rapidly over the next couple of weeks. Therefore, I made my first investment in the company a few days ago. There’s also a good chance that I will invest even more into Tucows later this week. Stay tuned to find out.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">I’ve watched this stock for more than 3 years, and I think it’s worth buying right now. If you believe in the airline industry long-term, then you will probably like this business. The name of the company is Chorus Aviation Inc (TSX: CHR). Headquartered in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Chorus’ focus is to provide the world with regional aviation. It does this through its subsidiaries. In Chorus’ own words, “[its] subsidiaries provide services that encompass every stage of a regional aircraft’s lifecycle, including: aircraft acquisition and leasing; aircraft refurbishment, engineering, modification, repurposing and transition; contract flying; aircraft and component maintenance, disassembly, and parts provisioning; and pilot training.”</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">What I like about Chorus is that it’s almost too big to fail. The company keeps a good amount of cash on hand, and when it comes to regional aircraft leasing, Chorus is the biggest lessor in the world. Considering how the airline industry was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, this could be one of the best times in history to invest in a business like Chorus Aviation. Since the company’s founding in 2006, the all-time lowest price for shares of CHR was $1.80 in the March 2020 market crash. Currently, CHR sits at $3.11 a share (prices in CAD). When you think about how much the world has changed over the last 3 years, it’s kind of surprising that this stock is only up 73%.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Fundamentally, CHR is an attractive investment. Other than the price-to-earnings ratio of 27, I like what I see. Not only does Chorus have a much smaller debt-to-capital ratio than the airline industry average, but it also has a greater profit margin than the industry average. In addition, CHR’s price-to-book ratio of 0.5 and price-to-sales ratio of 0.4 lead me to believe that the stock is undervalued. Last but not least, I like the graph of CHR.</span></span>

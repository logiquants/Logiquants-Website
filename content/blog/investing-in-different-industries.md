<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">In the first half of 2022, Information Technology has been the top-performing industry (+ 36.2%) on the TSX. The second and third best-performing industries on the TSX are Consumer Discretionary (+ 9.8%) and Industrials (+ 6.6%). Clearly, Information Technology has outperformed other industries significantly. While you probably wish that you had invested all your money into Information Technology at the beginning of the year, that wouldn’t have been a realistic approach. More specifically, it’s impossible to predict the industry that will perform best with 100% accuracy. Therefore, it’s better to invest in a few different industries that you believe will perform well. By doing so, you can reduce risk.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Now, let’s consider a quick example. Let’s say that Bob invested all of his money into the Energy sector at the beginning of the year. Well, Energy has been the worst-performing industry in 2023. If Bob had diversified by investing in another industry, his investments would be performing better. Lastly, Bob could reduce risk even more by investing in additional industries. Investing in multiple sectors increases the likelihood that one of your investments will be part of the top-performing sector.</span></span>

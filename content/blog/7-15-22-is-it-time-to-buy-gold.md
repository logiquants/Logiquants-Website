<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">After the market crash of March 2020, gold was one of the first industries to see a significant rebound in price. Within 5 weeks of the crash, numerous Canadian gold companies saw their shares rebound 100% or more (from the lows). But it didn’t end there. In just 6 months, some companies saw their shares increase more than 200% from the lows.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">During recessionary economic times, gold tends to be a safe haven for investors. Throughout previous recessions, its value has typically held or increased. Why am I bringing this point up? Recessions are often preceded by an inversion of the bond yield curve (I won’t go into detail on this). For the first time since March 2020, the Government of Canada benchmark bond yield curve is showing signs of a potential inversion. This is significant because it increases the odds of a recession and the likelihood that gold will outperform other investments.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">There are 2 more factors worth considering in the context of gold investment. First of all, I think there will be a huge increase in the demand for gold over the next 12 months. Not only did I just get engaged, but I’m attending 2 different weddings this summer, and another next summer! If wedding fever continues to spread and more people get engaged (which I believe will happen), there will be an increased demand for rings. Since rings are usually made from gold, an increase in the demand for rings also means an increase in the demand for gold. The second factor worth considering is that gold stocks have performed well over 2 of the 3 last summers (in 2019 and 2020). Have you ever heard the saying, “the trend is your friend?” If not, then get used to me saying it because it applies to the stock market all too often! Although gold stocks declined last summer, there’s about a 2/3 chance that they increase in value this summer, and I will be betting accordingly.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">With interest rates on the rise, and the stock market in a slump, it may be a bit early to start investing in gold. As such, I suggest using dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk. Dollar-cost averaging entails “investing equal amounts, spaced out over regular intervals, regardless of price.”<sup>1</sup> Whether or not you implement this strategy, buying gold companies at these low-price levels should turn out to be a great investment in the medium to long-term. With that said, investment returns are never guaranteed. Don’t invest money that you will need within the next couple of years.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">On another note, I recommend allocating roughly 5% of one's investment portfolio to gold. Depending on the size of the portfolio, this could include any combination of individual gold companies, gold ETFs, gold mutual funds, and physical gold. Someone managing an investment portfolio worth a million dollars can invest way more into gold than someone who manages a $20,000 portfolio. Thus, with 5% of each portfolio invested in gold, the million-dollar portfolio would be more likely to hold individual gold companies and the $20,000 portfolio would be more likely to hold gold ETFs/mutual funds. The reason for this is risk management.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Although buying shares of individual companies can result in a much greater return, it also involves a lot more risk. The risk of investing in individual companies is much more concerning for someone investing $1,000 ($20,000 x 5%) versus someone investing $50,000 ($1,000,000 x 5%). With $50,000 to invest, the money can be spread out between different companies (reducing risk through diversification). In comparison, it's much harder to achieve the same results with $1,000. This is where Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds come into play. For those who don't know, ETFs and mutual funds are investment types that already consist of a diverse portfolio. ETFs and mutual funds are the best options for reducing risk in smaller investment portfolios.</span></span>

When it comes to investing, you always need to consider risk. While it’s possible that Dogecoin could increase in value for the rest of our lives, it’s just as possible that it becomes worthless. Don’t invest money into it that you can’t afford to lose. With that said, Dogecoin is an investment worth buying right now. Although I don’t hold much of the coin, I have been an investor since 2021. I originally paid 5¢ per coin, and until now, I hadn’t thought about buying more.

With Elon Musk’s plan to create an ‘everything app’ from Twitter, a payment system will need to be implemented. It’s rumoured that the payment system will use ‘Twitter Coins’ and that they will be purchased with fiat currencies (CAD, USD, etc.). But there are also rumours that Twitter Coin may eventually support cryptocurrencies. If cryptocurrencies are indeed supported by Twitter Coin in the future, I have a good feeling that Dogecoin will be one of them. Elon is a long-time supporter of the coin. On top of that, Elon often says “Fate loves irony,” and what would be more ironic than a meme coin facilitating large-scale payments?

From a technical standpoint, I like the graph of Dogecoin. The price reached an all-time high of 73.8¢ in May 2021. Now sitting at 8.33¢, the price has fallen approximately 89%. When an investment falls this much, I like to see price action off of the bottom before I will make a purchase. This is especially true when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Between the short-term momentum Dogecoin has seen recently, and about a 69% increase from its 52-week low of 4.94¢, I like the price action that I see.

With Canada’s inflation over the last couple of years, many people have realized that you shouldn’t keep your whole net worth in cash. To put things simply, your cash loses purchasing power as inflation increases. For example, a can of beans that cost about $1.25 in 2021, now costs about $1.50. Thus, the price of canned beans has increased by roughly 20% since 2021. But your cash isn’t magically able to buy 20% more items. That’s why it’s important to buy assets that will appreciate in value. Otherwise, you subject yourself to inflation risk, and there may come a time when you can no longer afford the items that you once could.

Now, like me, you’re probably wondering what assets will best keep up with inflation. Real estate, lumber, metals, oil and gas are my main picks, but one alternative investment that could perform well is cars. It would also be smart to make investments in concrete, water, foods like corn and wheat, as well as some cryptocurrencies. At this point, you might be wondering why I have chosen some of these assets, but I have well-thought reasons for each. My opinions are influenced by one basic economic concept; people have unlimited wants (desires), that must be fulfilled with limited resources (since the world contains a finite amount). The result of this concept is that people are forced to make choices when it comes to their wants and how they spend their (limited) money. On that note, if you could predict what people value the most in life, and will spend their money on, then you could reap a big reward.

Predicting what people will spend their money on is exactly what I’m trying to do. With that being said, real estate, lumber, metals, oil and gas are great candidates for 2023. Since these assets have a limited supply, and Canada’s population size is growing daily, it’s inevitable that the prices of these assets will inflate over time. To illustrate my point, consider Canada’s housing shortage. Canada immigrated a record number of people in 2022 and there are plans to beat that record again in 2023. However, housing isn’t being built fast enough to keep up with this rapid increase in population. This will cause real estate prices to further inflate, as the shortage worsens. When real estate prices inflate, lumber prices will too.

Investors often use metals like gold and silver as a way to protect themselves against inflation, but there are also numerous metals required for electric vehicle production. Unfortunately, there will be a shortage of some metals and just like with housing, as the shortage worsens, inflation will increase. Last but not least, oil and gas will experience much higher demand with the coming increases in population size. Without getting into all the different uses of oil and gas, let's consider just heating and transportation. Having more people in the country means that we will need both more heating and more transportation. As a result, the price of oil and gas will likely inflate.

While I could have gone into much further detail with each of the topics mentioned in this article, my goal is simply to make everyday Canadians aware of what’s going on in the current economy. Our government’s actions have consequences and if you know the different possibilities, it’s much easier to navigate them.

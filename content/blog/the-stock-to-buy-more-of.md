<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Out of all the stock picks in our premium research section, this is the one that I would buy more of right now. Since writing about BlackBerry (TSX: BB)(NYSE: BB) on May 3, 2023, the S&P/TSX Composite Index has declined by about 4.45%. BlackBerry stock, however, has increased by 7% since then. This is an amazing sign. In my experience, if a stock rises in price while the index is declining, thereâ€™s a good chance the stock will continue to rise in price. Consequently, I expect shares of BlackBerry to continue appreciating in value.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">I had a LogiQuants subscriber ask me to analyze Artizia (TSX: ATZ). I hope this article helps!</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Before I will buy a stock, or write about a stock on this website, I always look at its graph. Upon looking at the all-time graph of ATZ, I noticed that the stock hit an all-time low of $9.20 in March 2020. The price per share has increased by about 355% since then, as it currently sits at $41.91. In January 2022, ATZ reached a high of $60.64 per share. This means that shares of ATZ have declined approximately 31% over the last 15 months.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Although I believe Aritzia shares will increase in price, this is not a company that I will be investing in. I look for investments with better risk-to-reward opportunities. With that said, from a technical standpoint, I like the graph of ATZ. Its short-term charts are building good momentum. While I think the stock price has bottomed short-term, it could still drop another 12% over the next few months. I would be surprised if it fell further than that.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Now, let’s consider Aritzia’s fundamentals. The company’s net income in its most recent quarter increased by 8.9% compared to the same quarter 1 year prior. Furthermore, Aritzia’s annual net income has climbed in 4 out of the last 5 years. Regarding the price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio, ATZ is slightly higher than the industry averages. The apparel industry’s average price-to-earnings ratio and average price-to-book ratio are 25.1 and 6.8, respectively. ATZ has a price-to-earnings ratio of 26.2 and a price-to-book ratio of 7.2, indicating that it may be slightly overvalued compared to industry peers.</span></span>

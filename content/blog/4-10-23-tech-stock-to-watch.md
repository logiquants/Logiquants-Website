Although the technology sector may take longer to perform than other industries, I have faith that it will come back sooner rather than later. Some tech stocks have been hammered so badly, that I’m not sure the price can fall much lower. One such stock is Lightspeed Commerce Inc (TSX: LSPD)(NYSE: LSPD). I have been trading this stock for years. In fact, I sold most of my shares at about $150 (CAD) each, back in September 2021. At the time of writing this article, shares of Lightspeed are trading at $18.65 (CAD).

The price of Lightspeed stock hit an all-time high of $165.87 in September 2021. Since then, the price has fallen 88.7%. Given the acquisitions that Lightspeed has made in recent years and the company’s ample amount of cash, there’s a good chance that its stock price has bottomed. The biggest risk, however, comes from the fact that Lightspeed has a negative net income. Net income is calculated by subtracting expenses, taxes and interest from revenue. So in other words, Lightspeed doesn’t make money.

While some readers may think I’m crazy to buy a company that doesn’t make money, remember the saying “no risk, no reward.” I like to take educated risks, and Lightspeed is one with great potential. The company’s sales have grown in each of the last 5 years. Moreover, management expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to turn positive or break even in the next 12 months. This is promising, especially considering Lightspeed’s 1.03% debt-to-capital, its price-to-book ratio of 0.8, and its price-to-sales ratio of 3.0. These are quite low compared to the software industry’s averages of 37.96% debt-to-capital, a price-to-book ratio of 16.8, and a price-to-sales ratio of 9.4. If Lightspeed starts to make money this year, the company’s shares should perform very well.

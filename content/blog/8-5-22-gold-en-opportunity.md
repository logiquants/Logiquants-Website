Alamos Gold Inc (TSX: AGI)(NYSE: AGI) is an investment worth buying right now. To find favourable stock picks in differing market conditions, I utilize multiple stock screeners. I have been using these screeners for years, and they have increased my winning rate significantly. With that said, AGI appeared on 3 of my 4 stock screeners last night. I can't stress enough that this happens very rarely. As usual, I recommend cost-averaging, but any purchase below $10.50/share should make for a sound investment medium to long term.

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Alamos Gold Inc (TSX: AGI)(NYSE: AGI) is an investment worth buying right now. To find favourable stock picks in differing market conditions, I utilize multiple stock screeners. I have been using these screeners for years, and they have increased my winning rate significantly. With that said, AGI appeared on 3 of my 4 stock screeners last night. I can't stress enough that this happens very rarely. As usual, I recommend cost-averaging, but any purchase below $10.50/share should make for a sound investment medium to long term.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Alamos produces gold and its main operations are in Mexico and Canada. In Mexico, the company operates the El Chanate and Mulatos mines. In Canada, Alamos manages the Young-Davidson and Island Gold mines. Out of all of these, the Young-Davidson mine brings in the most revenue.</span></span>

### The Good

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">I use a lot of different technical analysis indicators, and I like the graph of AGI. On top of that, the CEO of Alamos has been buying shares every month. He currently holds about 1 million in total, which signifies his confidence in the business. This is noteworthy because he was previously a director of the World Gold Council. Last but not least, AGI comes with an annual dividend yield of 1.34%.</span></span>

### The Bad

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">I prefer to invest in companies that hold a fair amount of their assets in cash, and that is not the case with Alamos Gold Inc. For the quarter ending June 2022, cash and cash equivalents made up roughly 3.4% of Alamos' total assets. Pair this with the fact that current liabilities were greater than the amount of cash on hand, and there's cause for concern. Nonetheless, CEO John McCluskey co-founded this company back in 2003, so I trust that he knows what he's doing.</span></span>

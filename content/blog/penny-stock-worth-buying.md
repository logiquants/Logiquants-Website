<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">This stock is not for the risk-averse. I don’t write about penny stocks often, and that’s because they’re usually more risky. So, do not put money into this stock that you can’t afford to lose. With that warning out of the way, I wouldn’t bother writing about a risky stock like this if it didn’t have the potential to be a big winner. At just $0.10/share, I believe this stock price will multiply quickly. I wouldn’t be surprised if it reached somewhere in the range of $0.20 to $0.70 before the end of the year.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">The name of the company is Lxrandco Inc (TSX: LXR). LXR is a socially responsible, digital-first omnichannel retailer of branded vintage luxury handbags and other personal accessories. It provides consumers with authenticated branded luxury products by promoting their reuse and by providing an environmentally responsible way for consumers to purchase luxury products. The company curates, sources and authenticates high-quality, pre-owned products from iconic brands such as Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada and Chanel. LXR sells its products through two primary distribution channels: e-commerce activities, which comprise its website and partner websites, and retail channels, which include its own stores and wholesale partner retail stores.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Consider this: society's older generations still hold a majority of the available wealth, and many of them value name brands extensively. Thus, as these individuals continue to face increasing inflation, I expect to see more and more of them start buying used luxury items. After all, if you had to choose between purchasing basic necessities and having the nicest new luxury items, what would it be? The logical answer is to choose basic necessities. With that said, I don't expect older generations to give up purchasing luxury items entirely. It seems more likely that they will reduce the amount of money they spend on these luxury items, instead. And how can they do that? By purchasing pre-owned items from LXR!</span></span>

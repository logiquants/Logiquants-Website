<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">When it comes to managing your investment portfolio, the best actions to take are sometimes counterintuitive. With that said, some people may never think to buy more of an investment that they already hold and have gained money on. But that’s exactly what you should do. Obviously, you shouldn’t put 50% of your money into a single company. That would be irresponsible. But as long as you’re managing risk, buying more of an investment that’s on an upward trend can greatly benefit your portfolio returns. In my experience, this strategy has been one of the main reasons that my investments perform so well. FEED YOUR WINNERS if you want to maximize your investment returns.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">A LogiQuants subscriber asked me to analyze Barrick Gold Corporation (TSX: ABX)(NYSE: GOLD).</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Overall, I like this stock. I think it will perform well in the medium and long term. With that said, the graph makes me believe that the share price will fall short term. Currently, ABX sits at $23.38 a share; but, don’t be surprised if it falls to $22.00. Anywhere around $22.50 is a good buying opportunity, as I believe the share price will increase from there. If I’m wrong and the share price continues to decline, $21.43 is the price to watch. If ABX falls below $21.43 a share, then it will likely continue to fall in price. For that reason, I would sell ABX for a loss if it falls below $21.43. Sure, selling for a loss stings, but making your losses even bigger stings that much more.</span></span>

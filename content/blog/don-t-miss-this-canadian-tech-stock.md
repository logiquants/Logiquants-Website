<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">The last time that I traded this stock, I made about 6x my initial investment. I haven’t touched it ever since. But that might change pretty soon, as the chart setup looks promising (based on technical analysis). I think 2023 will be a good year for shares of BlackBerry Ltd (TSX: BB)(NYSE: BB).</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">For those who have yet to read my 2022 analysis of BlackBerry, [you can find it here](https://www.logiquants.ca/blog/7-22-22-blackberry-of-the-future/). In it, I mentioned that I was confident BlackBerry would do well long-term, although I was not an investor. Since then, BlackBerry reported a profit of 12 million dollars in fiscal 2022, and a loss of 734 million in fiscal 2023 (prices in USD). Compared to fiscal 2021, the company’s net income is improving.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">From a technical standpoint, I really like the graph of BB stock. BlackBerry has been around for more than 20 years, and the all-time low for its stock price was $2.20 (CAD) in October 2002. In the last 10 years, the lowest price that BB shares have reached is $3.94 (CAD) in March 2020. At the time of writing this article, the price sits at $5.96 (CAD) a share; that’s only 51% higher than the lowest price in the last 10 years. Now, let’s consider the highest price that BB has reached in the last 10 years. In January 2021, the price reached a high of $36.00 (CAD). Considering that the current price of BB is down 83% from the high of the last 10 years and up 51% from the low of the last 10 years, this is a good entry point. In other words, if you believe in BlackBerry’s business long-term, it’s time to buy shares of BB.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">With the overall choppiness of the stock market this week, any stocks that have performed well should be added to your watchlist; BlackBerry is one of them. Last but not least, when it comes to analyzing the short-term price graphs of a stock, it’s important to look at volume. BB shares went from a low of $5.22, on Monday, to a high of 6.01, today. That’s a gain of more than 15% in just 2 days. While that fact is impressive in itself, it's even more impressive that it happened with a low volume of shares traded.</span></span>

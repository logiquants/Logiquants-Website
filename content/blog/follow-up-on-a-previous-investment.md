To all of the LogiQuants subscribers, thank you for your loyalty! I will continue to do my best in monitoring the investments I previously said were worth buying.

On that note, Iamgold Corp (TSX: IMG) is an investment that I previously wrote about buying. For those of you who have made money on this stock, but have yet to sell **any** of it, consider selling a portion of your initial investment. For example, if I had initially put $5000 into IMG (on July 19), my investment would now be worth more than $10,000, and I would sell about half my shares. Having doubled my money on this stock in less than a year, now is the time to manage risk. Think of it this way — doubling your money on a stock and then selling half of your shares, means that what’s left of your investment is basically “risk-free.” With an initial investment of $5000 turning into more than $10000, that’s a (potential) profit of $5000. By selling half of your shares, the remaining shares that you hold are essentially free; the profit from your initial investment paid for them.

While I believe that shares of Iamgold will continue to rise in price, risk management is essential to making money in the stock market.

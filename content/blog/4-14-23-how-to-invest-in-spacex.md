<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Space Exploration Technologies Corp, also known as SpaceX, is a company founded by Elon Musk. The 3 main focuses of the business are Starlink, space transportation, and space tourism. I’m not going to get into the details on space transportation or tourism, but for those who don’t already know, Starlink is an internet service. What’s special about Starlink is that it will provide internet to underserved/unserved areas through the use of satellites. This is a huge opportunity because almost a third of the world’s population is in unserved internet regions.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">So how can you invest in SpaceX? Well, unfortunately, the company is private. This means SpaceX doesn’t have shares that trade on a public stock exchange. Making a direct investment into SpaceX must be done privately, and everyday investors are usually unable to do so. There are indirect ways to invest in the business, however. More specifically, this can be achieved by purchasing investments that contain SpaceX as an investment. For example, you could buy an ETF or mutual fund with a stake in SpaceX, or you could buy shares of a company that holds investments in SpaceX (like Alphabet, Google’s parent company). Another way to indirectly invest in SpaceX is to invest in its partners and suppliers.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Last but not least, for my fellow Canadians, there’s a way to invest in SpaceX (indirectly) using Canadian dollars. Stack Capital Group Inc (TSX: STCK) is an investment holding company based in Toronto. The business invests in growth to late-stage private companies, intending to maximize (risk-adjusted) investment returns. On that note, I want to emphasize that SpaceX makes up only 9% of Stack Capital’s investment portfolio. In other words, for every dollar invested into STCK, only 9¢ is invested into SpaceX. I haven’t thoroughly researched all of the other companies in Stack Capital’s investment portfolio, but you can find them here.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">A LogiQuants subscriber asked me to analyze Wall Financial Corporation (TSX: WFC). Here it is!</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Wall Financial Corporation is in the business of developing real estate and investing in real estate. More specifically, the company develops and constructs residential housing units for sale, while also focusing on developing and managing hotel properties, commercial rental units, and residential rental units. With Wall Financial’s headquarters being in Vancouver, it makes sense that many of its properties are located there too. The only 2 hotels owned by the company are in Vancouver: the Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre Hotel and the Westin Wall Centre Vancouver Airport Hotel. Since Wall Financial’s founding in 1962, it “has developed more than 30,000 homes including over 15,000 rental units in Metro Vancouver, thousands of single-family lots, [and] over 10,000 condominiums.”</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">While the nature of Wall Financial’s business is attractive from an investment standpoint, it’s important to consider the risks at hand before actually investing. With that said, 3 risks stand out to me. WFC stock has a low percentage of institutional shareholders, the (daily) average volume of shares traded is low, and the founder of the company, Peter Wall, holds about 53.5% of the company’s shares. In my experience, the fewer institutional shareholders a stock has, the more risky it typically is. WFC has 0.02% institutional ownership, which is very low. Another guideline of mine is that I usually like to stay away from stocks with an average volume of 5,000 or less. My reasoning is that you can’t sell a stock with 0 volume, as there wouldn’t be any buyers. WFC has an average volume of 1,595. Lastly, depending on how you view it, it’s either a benefit or a risk that Peter Wall holds 53.5% of WFC shares. Although it shows his confidence in the company, I view it as a risk because he could single-handedly drop the price of WFC if he decided to sell shares.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Now that the risks are out of the way, let’s consider WFC's dividend and price graph. On the surface, WFC’s 15% dividend looks very attractive; however, the dividend payout ratio is not. Other than the dividend paid on March 3, 2023, the most recent dividend paid before then was on June 26, 2019. In terms of the stock’s graph, WFC reached an all-time high of $38.95 in December 2019. In the last 5 years, the lowest price that WFC has reached was $11 in July 2022. The share price is up 79% since then. While I believe this momentum will continue, the price per share of WFC currently sits at 19.70, and that’s a price I wouldn’t pay. Why? The risk-to-reward ratio isn’t optimal. Instead of buying at $19.70, I would wait and see if the share price breaks above $20.50. It may seem dumb to pay more, but WFC reached a high of $20.50/share on February 15th. Unless the share price breaks above this threshold, WFC will likely fall in price.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Verdict:

Unless the stock price breaks above $20.50, I wouldn’t buy WFC. If it does break above $20.50, buy it.

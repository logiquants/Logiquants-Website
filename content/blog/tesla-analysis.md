<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">I recently had a LogiQuants subscriber ask what I thought about shares of Tesla. To that special reader, here is the article you asked for! Let me know if you have any questions.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Although I wouldn’t buy TSLA right now, if I was already an investor, I would consider holding my shares. The decision comes down to how much of your portfolio is invested in Tesla. For example, let’s say that my investment account is worth $5000 and I have $2000 in TSLA. Even if I was taking a loss, I would sell about half of my shares. Why? Rather than keep so many of my eggs in one basket (Tesla), I would prefer to put $1000 into another investment. Having too much money in a single company is risky.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">With that warning out of the way, I also want to acknowledge that Tesla stock could go up or down (in price) from here. I’m leaning toward it going up, but there’s no saying for certain. If I had an investment in Tesla, and I was down more than 20% on it, I would hold my shares (assuming that I didn’t have too much of my portfolio in it). Given that Tesla has only been profitable since 2020, and the company’s net income is increasing, the stock could perform very well. But I also wouldn’t be shocked if TSLA shares fell another 60% in the next year.</span></span>

1. <span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">• If you’ve gained on your investment in Tesla or lost less than 20%, consider selling some of your shares.  
   • If you’re down more than 20% on your TSLA shares, determine their percentage of your portfolio.

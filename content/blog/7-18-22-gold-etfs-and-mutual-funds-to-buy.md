<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">In this article, I will discuss a few different gold ETFs and mutual funds worth buying. </span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Of the different gold ETFs available in Canada, the 2 that I would consider buying are iShares S&P/TSX Global Gold Index ETF (TSX: XGD) and BMO Junior Gold Index ETF (TSX: ZJG). The main difference between the two is that XGD's holdings are concentrated in large-cap gold companies, whereas ZJG's holdings are not. A large-cap is a "company with a market capitalization value of more than $10 billion." ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp")) So, if you think that big gold companies will perform well, you should buy XGD. If you think small and mid-sized gold companies will perform well, you should buy ZJG. If you think they will all perform well, you could buy both XGD and ZJG. I think that small and mid-sized gold companies will outperform large-cap companies. For that reason, ZJG is my number one pick for gold ETFs.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">For gold mutual funds, I narrowed my list down to 4 favourites: BMO Precious Metals F (BMO95147), RBC Global Precious Metals Fund F (RBF614), Mackenzie Precious Metals D (MFC8535), and Dynamic Strategic Gold Class Series F (DYN2303). All of these funds have similar costs (also known as management expense ratios or MERs). The main question to consider when you're deciding which fund to buy is what you would prefer to have your money invested in. For instance, do you want more of the money you invest to go into large-cap gold companies or gold bullion (ounces)? If you prefer large-cap gold companies, then you should buy BMO95147, and if you prefer gold bullion, you should buy DYN2303. If you decide you're okay forgoing gold bullion but would like a mix of different-sized gold companies, RBF614 and MFC8535 are both great options.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Finally, for any readers learning about ETFs or mutual funds for the first time, there are 2 main differences to consider between them. The first is that, in general, ETFs charge lower MERs than mutual funds. For example, XGD and ZJG both charge an MER of 0.61%, and RBF614 has the lowest MER out of the 4 mutual funds at 0.99%. The second difference to note is that ETFs can be traded like stocks, whereas mutual funds are meant to be held more long-term. If a mutual fund is sold in its first 30 days of being held, a short-term redemption fee is usually charged.</span></span>

Tomorrow, I will release a follow-up article on which individual gold companies to buy.</span></span>

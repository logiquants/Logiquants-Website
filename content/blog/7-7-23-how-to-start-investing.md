### **Step 1: Open an Investment Account.**

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">There are many different types of investment accounts in Canada. But for someone without any previous investing experience, a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is generally a good first choice.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">A TFSA lets Canadian residents who are at least 18 years of age grow their wealth tax-free. The main catch with a TFSA is that the amount of money you can contribute to it is limited. This limit is also known as contribution room. To check your TFSA contribution room, simply log in to your account with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and locate the information.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Once you have decided on the type of investment account to open, it’s time to choose what brokerage to open it with. For those of you who do your banking with TD, if you want to make life easy, open an investment account with TD Direct Investing. For everyone else, read my article on [The Best Brokerages in Canada](https://www.logiquants.ca/blog/7-1-22-the-best-brokerages-in-canada/) to help determine which brokerage you should go with. Once you have settled on a decision, open an investment account with the brokerage.</span></span>

### **Step 2: Transfer Money Into the Investment Account.**

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Depending on the type of investment account you open, there are different rules/limitations associated with transferring money into it. For example, consider the TFSA contribution room, as mentioned above. According to the CRA, the TFSA contribution room is the total amount of all of the following:</span></span>

1. <span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">• the TFSA dollar limit of the current year ($6,500 for 2023)  
   • any unused TFSA contribution room from previous years  
   • any withdrawals made from the TFSA in the previous year
2. </span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Therefore, a Canadian resident turning 18 years old in 2023 would have only $6,500 of TFSA contribution room. If the same 18-year-old Canadian resident chose to contribute $500 to a TFSA in 2023, the $6,000 ($6,500-$500) in unused contribution room would carry forward. Let’s imagine that the TFSA dollar limit for 2024 is $7,000. Then $6,000 in unused contribution room from 2023, along with the additional $7,000 limit in 2024, would make this individual’s total contribution room $13,000 ($6,000+$7,000). This means the individual could transfer no more than $13,000 to his/her TFSA in 2024, without any tax implications.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">In terms of actually administering a money transfer to your investment account, most brokerages allow you to do it yourself, online. If you prefer to have someone guide you or even do it for you, you could also call the respective brokerage. There are numerous ways to fund your investment account.</span></span>

### **Step 3: Research.**

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">One of the most important aspects of investing is research. Without research, there’s a greater chance you will invest in bad companies, and as a result, lose money. If you’re going to put money at risk, the least you can do is make sure it’s a risk worth taking. By conducting high-quality research, there’s usually a better chance that your investments will perform well. I put many hours of research into every investment decision that I make. That’s actually why I started the Premium Investment Research section of the website. My thought was that if I can save my readers time, and I’m going to spend countless hours researching for myself anyway, why not just sell my best research to those who are willing to subscribe? So, that’s exactly what I did.</span></span>

### **Step 4: Buy.**

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">After you’re satisfied with your research, it’s time to put it to use. Log in to your online brokerage account, and find the investment that you’re interested in buying. While some new investors may choose to invest in individual companies, it’s usually safer to stick with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds when you’re first starting. This comes down to the saying that you shouldn’t put all of your eggs in one basket. ETFs and Mutual funds are both investment products that issue units of a fund; when you buy units of a fund, you're investing in a group of investments.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">By containing a group of different investments, both ETFs and mutual funds provide diversified risk. This diversified risk does have a small cost, however, as most ETFs and mutual funds charge fees. With that said, it’s worth noting that ETFs typically have lower fees than mutual funds. Another difference between the two is that mutual funds usually have a minimum holding period, whereas ETFs do not. There is often a penalty for selling units of a mutual fund before the end of the minimum holding period.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">When it comes to submitting the buy order for the investment you want to purchase, there are only a few things that you need to know. First of all, enter the number of units you want to purchase. If you’re buying a stock or ETF, you also need to specify the order/price type and how long the order is good until. Since there are multiple different order/price types, let’s focus on market orders. A market order is an order to buy the investment, immediately, at the current market price. When specifying how long the order is good until, I usually choose 1 day, but you can make it much longer than that.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">If you’re buying a mutual fund, more often than not, there is a minimum initial investment. For instance, DYN253 is a mutual fund with a minimum initial investment of $500. If you tried to make your first purchase of DYN253 with only $400, your order would be declined. When submitting a buy order for a mutual fund, you will need to choose a dividend option too. Think of dividends as payments of income which are made to you, the investor. You can choose to either receive your dividend in cash or have it re-invested into the same mutual fund. Once you’re comfortable with the details of your order, submit it. Unlike stocks or ETFs, when you buy a mutual fund, it can take up to 3 business days for the units to appear in your investment account.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Last but not least, it’s crucial to keep in mind that your investments won’t always increase in value. If you can’t stomach the thought of losing money on an investment, then investing may not be for you. What’s truly important is that you have more winning investments than you do losing investments; that way, you’re still winning overall.</span></span>

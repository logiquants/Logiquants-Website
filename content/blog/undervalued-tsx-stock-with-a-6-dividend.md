<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">For those of you who like dividends, this is an opportunity you don’t want to miss!</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Headquartered in Newmarket, Ontario, AirBoss of America Corp. (TSX: BOS) manufactures rubber-based products. In the company’s own words, these “rubber-based products [are] for industries including automotive, heavy commercial, construction and infrastructure, oil & gas, and defense.” With sales in both the United States and Canada, AirBoss has increased its net income in 4 of the last 5 years. What makes shares of BOS so attractive to me is that they not only have an annual dividend yield of 6.18% but there’s a good chance they will appreciate in value.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">In January 2022, BOS reached an all-time high of $47.00 a share (prices in CAD). At the time of writing this article, BOS costs $6.47 a share. In just 17 months, the price has fallen by a whopping 86.23%. Even during the market crash of March 2020, the lowest price that BOS reached was $4.59 – only 29.05% less than now. With a book value of $9.87 a share and a price-to-sales ratio of 0.28, I believe that AirBoss’ stock is undervalued. In the last 12 months, company insiders have made 2 buys of BOS and 0 sells. Last but not least, 10.43% of shareholders are institutions.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">The oil and gas industry currently has some great opportunities. More specifically, there are a number of Canadian businesses worth investing in. A couple that stand out to me are Baytex Energy Corp (BTE) and Crescent Point Energy Corp (CPG). Each of these companies’ shares trade on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.

### Baytex Energy Corp

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Baytex Energy Corp is based in Calgary, Alberta. The business primarily focuses on acquiring, developing, and producing oil and natural gas resources. With operations in the United States and Canada, Baytex concentrates on 5 core areas: Eagle Ford in Texas, Duvernay in Alberta, Peace River in Alberta, Viking in Alberta/Saskatchewan, and Lloydminster in Alberta/Saskatchewan. The company is committed to responsible resource development and strives to operate in an environmentally sustainable manner.

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Now, let’s consider the fundamentals of shares in Baytex Energy Corp. Unfortunately, the company does not pay a dividend. But other than that, shares of BTE are quite attractive. The price-to-earnings ratio is only 3, which is low compared to the industry average of 6.3. On top of that, the industry average profit margin is -18.03%, whereas Baytex’s is 36.78%. Compared to other companies in the Canadian oil and gas industry, BTE stock is undervalued. Lastly, the price-to-book ratio of BTE stock is 0.83, which is low. This serves as another indicator that the stock may be undervalued.

### Crescent Point Energy Corp

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Crescent Point Energy Corp is based in Calgary, Alberta. The company's focus is on developing and exploiting oil and natural gas reserves, using advanced drilling techniques to maximize efficiency and minimize environmental impact. Crescent Point has operations in the United States and Canada, focusing on 5 main regions: Williams County in North Dakota, Kaybob Duvernay in Alberta, Shaunavon in Saskatchewan, Flat Lake in Saskatchewan, and Viewfield Bakken in Saskatchewan. Crescent Point aims to maintain a sustainable business model by prioritizing operational excellence, financial discipline, and strategic capital allocation.

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Finally, we will consider the fundamentals of shares in Crescent Point Energy Corp. One appealing aspect of CPG shares is that they pay a dividend. The annual dividend yield is about 4.5%. What makes CPG even more attractive, however, are its price-to-earnings ratio of 3.5 and its price-to-book ratio of 0.75. These numbers indicate that the stock is likely undervalued. As noted earlier, the Canadian oil and gas industry has an average price-to-earnings ratio of 6.3 and an average profit margin of -18.03%. Did I mention that Crescent Point’s profit margin is 37.15%? CPG stock is a tempting investment at the moment; in fact, I bought more on Friday.

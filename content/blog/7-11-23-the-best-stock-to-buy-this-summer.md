<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Westport Fuel Systems Inc (TSX: WPRT)(NASDAQ: WPRT) is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The focus of the business is on clean transportation technology. Westport engineers, builds and supplies “clean and affordable alternative fuel systems and components for automotive applications.” With customers in 70+ countries, Westport aims to address both climate change and urban air quality. As emission regulations continue to become more strict around the world, Westport is positioned to do well.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Regarding shares of WPRT, I really like the graph. The moving average convergence/divergence (MACD line) is starting to look promising. A few other buy signals I look for are also beginning to appear. In February 2021, WPRT reached a high of $164.90/share (prices in CAD). Compared to the current price of $10.30, WPRT has been significantly more expensive in the past. Don’t be surprised if this stock’s price starts to increase quickly.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">I expect shares of WPRT to increase in price rapidly. For that reason, I made an investment in WPRT earlier today. Not only is this stock undervalued, but with society’s current focus on climate change and affordability, it seems that Westport has ‘hit the nail on the head,’ so to speak. In terms of fundamentals, Westport’s 5-year revenue growth is 5.87%, and its book value/share is $15.17. Given that the price-to-book ratio is 0.67, I’m confident WPRT is undervalued. Furthermore, I like that Westport keeps plenty of cash on hand and that the company’s debt-to-capital ratio (0.23) is less than the auto parts industry’s average (0.32).</span></span>

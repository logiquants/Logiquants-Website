<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Most of my recent articles have highlighted buying opportunities and my predictions for the economy/stock market. Though my opinions haven’t changed, and I believe inflation will continue to get worse, I want to emphasize risk management to LogiQuants’ readers. More specifically, it’s crucial that you never put every dollar you have into investments. Obviously, the goal is to make money and get ahead. But emotions play a role in investing, and the most successful investors can control their emotions.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">When every dollar you have is in investments, you’re essentially putting your well-being on the line, just for a chance at getting ahead. Being in such a scenario makes investing more high-stakes and stressful. To make matters worse, this is when people often ‘panic sell’ their investments. When everything is on the line, and their investments have lost money, people will sell to ensure they don’t lose even more. But this is the wrong way to think. More often than not, when people do this, the investment that they sold starts to increase in price. Had they not let their emotions get the best of them, they wouldn’t have taken as large of a loss.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">The easiest way to avoid being in the situation described above is to not invest too much of your money in the first place. Instead, keep enough cash to cover at least 3 months of living expenses. That way, if your investments don’t perform how you hoped they would, you already have the cash to cover your bills. This makes it easier to navigate the mind games that investing can put you through. As a result, you will be less likely to sell investments for a loss, based on your emotion at the time.</span></span>

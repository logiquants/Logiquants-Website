<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Do you remember Michael Wekerle, a former star from the show Dragons’ Den? In summary, he’s a well-established Canadian entrepreneur, and he owns the El Mocambo in Toronto. The reason I’m bringing him up today is that he owns about 9.5% of the company this article is about, Mogo Inc (TSX: MOGO)(NASDAQ: MOGO). More importantly, Mr. Wekerle sold a bunch of Mogo shares in both 2020 and 2021 but started buying again recently. On November 11, 2022, Mr. Wekerle bought 100,000 shares at a price of $0.882. Could this be a signal that now is the right time to invest in MOGO?</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Michael Wekerle isn’t the only insider buying shares of MOGO. In the last year, there have been more than 10 insider buys and 0 insider sells. This shows that management has confidence in the company’s future. Another fact worth mentioning is that Mogo Inc. owns the Canadian investing app, Moka. For those of you who have never heard of Moka, it’s “an app that helps you achieve your financial goals...One of the many ways [it] help[s] is by automatically rounding up every purchase you make and investing the spare change.”</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">From a technical analysis standpoint, I like the graph of MOGO. Now, am I guaranteeing that the stock will increase in price? No. But given the current setup of the graph, it does look likely that the price will increase. In March 2021, MOGO reached an all-time high of $15.34 and in December 2022, it hit an all-time low of $0.58. At the current price of $0.94, investing in MOGO provides optimal risk-to-reward.</span></span>

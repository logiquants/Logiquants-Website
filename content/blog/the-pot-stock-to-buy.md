<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Pot stocks have performed well the last couple of days, but there's only one on my watchlist. This company is rapidly expanding, and I have been keeping my eye on its shares for almost 2 years. Nova Cannabis Inc (TSX: NOVC) has more than 85 retail locations across Alberta, Ontario and Saskatchewan. The company primarily operates under the name “Value Buds.” Since the beginning of 2023, Nova Cannabis has already opened 3 new Value Buds locations (Banff, AB, Windsor, ON & London, ON).</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">The goal of Value Buds is “to make the cannabis experience accessible and affordable” by selling low-cost and high-value products. Considering the difficult financial times that many Canadians are in, it’s likely that consumers will choose Value Buds over its competitors. So if 2023 is a good year for pot stocks, it should be a great year for NOVC. The industry’s average price-to-sales ratio is 3.7, whereas Nova’s sits significantly lower at 0.2.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">In terms of the stock’s graph, it reached an all-time low of $0.34 on December 2, 2022. The price has more than doubled since then, as its currently at $0.69. I’m a fan of the NOVC graph, as it showed great momentum coming off of the bottom in December, and it has been consolidating (trading within a range) the last few months. Some readers may be skeptical of NOVC because it's a penny stock, but about 9% of shareholders are institutions. I’m confident this penny stock will perform well.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Everybody's talking about it lately - prices at the pumps are sky high! Although they have fallen since last week and could continue to short term, I'm confident gas prices will rise medium and long term. Yes, interest rates are increasing and asset prices should decrease accordingly. But there are additional factors to consider with oil and gas.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Before diving in, let's first remind ourselves what increasing interest rates mean for the economy as a whole: less money in circulation. With less money circulating in the economy, the population will have less money at their disposal than they previously did. In other words, members of the population will be forced to make choices about where they spend their money. This is basic economics - limited resources and unlimited wants.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">With that said, ask yourself what you think the average consumer spends their money on. According to Statistics Canada's numbers from 2019, transportation accounted for roughly 13.6% of all household spending.<sup>1</sup> But these numbers are from before the Covid-19 Pandemic, and a lot has happened since then. For example, many people living in cities headed for the suburbs and more rural places to live.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Now that Covid-19 mandates are coming to an end, much of the workforce will be required to commute to work again. For those who ditched urban living, this means a longer commute to work and more money spent on gas (assuming they don't own an electric vehicle, like most Canadians). On top of that, Ontario is currently administering shortened G license road tests to handle the huge "backlog caused by COVID-19 restrictions and closures."<sup>2</sup> This will cause an influx of new drivers on the road over the next couple of months.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Between longer commutes to work and additional drivers on the road, there will be a lot more gas needed. Gas is made from crude oil. Pair the increase in its demand with the United States of America's ban on Russian oil imports, and we have a recipe for prices to increase. After all, the United States will need to import extra oil from somewhere, and Canada is a likely source. Finally, I believe consumers would forgo other goods and services to maintain the role that transportation plays in their lives, rather than use less gas.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">From an investment perspective, the Oil and Gas sector presents amazing opportunities at the moment. My favourite company is Crescent Point Energy Corporation ($CPG). I'm biased, as I'm an investor myself. Crescent Point is an exploration and production company based in Calgary, Alberta.<sup>3</sup> With a price/book ratio of 0.94 and price/earnings ratio of 2.14, $CPG shares are certainly undervalued.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">While undervalued shares are appealing from a risk standpoint, another reason $CPG shares are attractive is the momentum they have signalled recently. On March 8th, 2022 shares of Crescent Point hit a new 52-week high of $10.08 - a price level last seen in July of 2018. The value delivered to shareholders has also been impressive; namely, a 50% dividend increase from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022.<sup>4</sup> This makes the annual dividend yield approximately 2.1%. Insider trades are yet another attention-drawing factor for shares of $CPG. More specifically, on Dec. 16, 2021, insider John Dielwart purchased all of his 175,000 shares at about $6.15 each, and Crescent Point CEO, Craig Bryksa, holds more shares than he ever has in the past.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Between John Dielwart making the biggest insider buy of $CPG in more than 4 years, and the CEO holding more shares than ever before, it's very unlikely to be coincidental. Last but not least, shares of Crescent Point Energy Corp. trade on both the TSX and the NYSE. Compared to a company that's listed on only one of the exchanges, Crescent Point should have much greater exposure to new investors. $CPG closed at $8.45 (CAD dollars) today, and my price target is $15.00 (CAD) within the next 18 months.</span></span>

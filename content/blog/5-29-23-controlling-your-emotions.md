<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">When the stock market is choppy, and your investments aren’t performing like you hoped they would, it’s easy to get down on yourself. This is typically when new investors get scared and sell their investments for a loss. I have seen it happen too many times, and I refer to it as ‘panic selling.’ To avoid panic selling, the key is to stay calm. Staying calm helps you make better decisions; thus, making you less likely to lose money. I know it’s easier said than done, but I have 3 rules to help achieve this.</span></span>

‎

### 1. DIVERSIFY

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">If you have $20,000 to invest, for example, don’t put all of it into a single company. Because If you do, and that company’s share price falls, it will quickly become more difficult to stay calm. Instead, spread the $20,000 between 6-8 different investments. That way, if one of your investments loses money, it will be easier to stay calm knowing that you have others. For someone investing with $2500 or less, the best way to diversify is to buy mutual funds and/or ETFs; otherwise, it’s pretty much impossible to achieve diversification.</span></span>

### 2. PLAN YOUR TRADE AND TRADE YOUR PLAN

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Come up with a plan for every investment/trade you make and act on the plan(s), accordingly. By doing so, you are mentally preparing for the different possible outcomes of your investments. By preparing for the different outcomes, you will be more calm when they aren’t in your favour. Furthermore, your plan might even involve buying more of an investment if it falls to a certain price. For those who come up with a plan before making an investment, when emotion gets involved, it’s crucial to follow through with the original plan. Why? Well, your brain was calm when the original plan was made, and by ‘trading your plan,’ you can deter emotion from swaying your investment decisions.</span></span>

### 3. HAVE THE RIGHT MINDSET

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">It’s impossible to stay calm about your investments if you have unrealistic expectations. So first of all, if you think you’re going to double your money every single year, check yourself. That’s not realistic. In any given year, you should expect to either lose money or make less than 25%. After all, the TSX Composite Index had an average annualized return of about 8% from 1971 to 2021. Since your investment returns will vary depending on your risk tolerance, these numbers are only a guideline of what to expect. By setting your expectations low, you’re more likely to stay calm when investment returns aren’t good.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Lastly, you need to think about investing like an entrepreneur would. If an entrepreneur was down 15% on an investment, would emotion get the best of them? Do you think they would panic, and sell the investment for a loss? A successful entrepreneur wouldn’t. I’m an entrepreneur myself, and even if I’m down 50% on an investment, it doesn’t bother me. I know that’s the nature of investing, and I’m in it for the long run. I also remind myself that it takes money to make money, and ‘patience pays.’ Overall, I approach investing with an entrepreneurial mindset. This helps me stay calm when investments don’t go the way that I expect them to.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">For any readers who can’t relate to the entrepreneurial mindset described above, you either need to start working on it or devise an alternative course of action. More specifically, you need to come up with a course of action that will help you stay calm when your investments are down. One alternative course of action is to avoid looking at or thinking about your investments when they’re down. My close friend does this, and it works well for him. He claims it’s the only way that he can stay calm when his investments are red.</span></span>

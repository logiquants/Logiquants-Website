##### Before starting LogiQuants, Cameron worked at TD Direct Investing as an Investment Representative. While there, he completed both the CSC® and CPH® from the Canadian Securities Institute. Prior to his time with TD, Cameron traded independently on a full-time basis.

##### In terms of educational background, Cameron spent 2 years studying Actuarial Science at Western University.  From there, he transferred to the University of Toronto, where he specialized in Statistics.

##### Though he already knew quite a bit at the time, Cameron first began investing in 2017. He is fortunate to have learned from his grandfather, who has been trading stocks full-time for the last 16 years. In addition to his grandfather's teachings, Cameron learned as much as he could about investing during his free time.
